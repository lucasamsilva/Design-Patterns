## Introduction

In this repository, you will find implementations of several well-known design patterns. Each pattern has its own directory containing code examples in multiple programming languages. The purpose of this repository is to provide clear and concise examples of design patterns to help developers understand and apply them in their own projects.

## Patterns Implemented

The following design patterns are currently implemented in this repository:

- Creational Patterns:
  - Singleton
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder
  - Prototype

- Structural Patterns:
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy

- Behavioral Patterns:
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command
  - Interpreter
  - Iterator
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - Observer
  - State
  - Strategy
  - Template Method
  - Visitor

## Languages Used

Currently, the patterns are implemented in the following programming languages:

- Java

Feel free to contribute implementations in other languages.
